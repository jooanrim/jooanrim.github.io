			<h1>My Most Favorite Ted Talk I've Found On Youtube</h1>
			<p>I'm a big fan of watching things on youtube that inspire me and make me MORE curious and want to learn MORE.  This Ted Talk has
			   been one of my favorites of all time and it talks about why motivators can be a bad thing
			   I see it constantly today that grades and the pressure of grades makes students do worse instead of better
			   This experiment shows me that by reducing anxiety and pressure that we can do better.  This is why I remind everyone to care
			   more about learning than grades</p>
