			<h1>Who am I?</h1>
			<p>My full name is Joo An Rim Kim but you can just call me Joo. I have two last names because I was born in Santiago, Chile; where it is customary to add the maternal last name behind the paternal. It was around October of 2002 when I moved to America to the humble bordertown, Laredo, Texas. Although I am currently in The University of Texas at Austin's College of Natural Sciences, I have decided that I would much rather enjoy pursuing an Advertising degree. My hobbies include learning about astrology, playing my ukulele, and going to concerts of all types.</p>
